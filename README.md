# Horiseon



## Description

This a social media marketing webpage sent from the client company Horiseon for code refactoring. The code had a lot of classes in the style sheet with repeated attributes, so i took it upon myself to combine and rename some of the classes and their respective modified attributes. In doing so, the page has a quicker starting process as the code has been DRY'd.
